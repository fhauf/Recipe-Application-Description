Description of Object Oriented Recipe Book Program

An online recipe book application would benefit from having an OOP design.  This application would allow users to create and manage food recipes and an associated shopping list. Specifically, the application would let users do the following:

1.  Create and save new food recipes.
2.  Update existing recipes e.g. change ingredients or quantities.
3.  Delete unwanted recipes.
4.  Share (email) recipes with other users.
4.  Add new ingredients and associate them with recipes.
5.  Identify ingredients to be purchased i.e. added to a shopping list.
5.  Remove ingredients from recipes.
6.  Create a new shopping list.
7.  Update ingredients on an existing shopping list.
8.  Delete old shopping lists.
9. Send (email) shopping list.
10. Create, update, delete user name and password information.

The application flow is as follows:

The user signs in using his/her email and password.  A list of previously created recipes appears on the left side of the screen (if any exist). When a recipe is clicked, a recipe detail view with picture, ingredient list, and instructions is presented on the right side of the screen. The user can scroll down to view all the recipe details. The user can click on an ingredient and send it to the user's current shopping list.  If a shopping list does not exist yet it will be created automatically.  Print and email recipe functionality is also available if the user wishes to print the recipe or share it with others.

Below the recipe list and recipe detail sections is the shopping list section. The shopping list contains all the ingredients that the user selected when viewing the recipe details for one or more recipes.  In addition, Add, Delete, and Save buttons exist to allow the user to add ingredients that are not yet linked to a recipe, to delete an ingredient from the shopping list, to Ssve the updated current shopping list, or to delete the shopping list altogether.  Print and email functionality is also available to allow the user to print or email the shopping list.
