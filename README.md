# Recipe-Application-Description

The Assignment 12 Object Oriented Recipe Book Program.md file describes a project that would benefit greatly from an OOP structure. It also describes the application flow from the user's point of view (user stories).

The Recipe Application Objects.pdf file depicts the main objects of the application and how they would relate to each other.
